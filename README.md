# rsdtlib: Remote Sensing with Deep-Temporal Data Library

This project provides a Python module that allows:
- **Stage 1:** Download remote sensing data directly from [Sentinel Hub](https://www.sentinel-hub.com/) (i.e. Sentinel 1 & 2), or convert existing `GeoTIFF` files
- **Stage 2:** Temporally stack, assemble, and tile these observations
- **Stage 3:** Create windows of longer time series comprising these observations (i.e. deep-temporal)

Below figure shows the processing pipeline considering all three stages:

</p>

The processing in stages 2 and 3 is detailed below, showing how observations are combined to produce the final windows:

</p>

# Documentation
The documentation is hosted on Github Pages [here](https://it4innovations.github.io/rsdtlib/_build/html/index.html).

# Example
All examples are in folder [examples](./examples). These examples, as shown below, demonstrate each stage.

*Note:* Except for the download stage, all examples can be executed directly. For the download stage, the credentials for `Sentinel Hub` need to be added to the script to work.

## Stage 1: Download or Convert
Observations can either be directly downloaded form `Sentinel Hub` or pre-processed locally as `GeoTIFF` files and converted to `EOPatch` samples.

### Download from Sentinel Hub
The following downloads all Sentinel 1 and 2 observations from first half of 2017, for the region specified in a shape file (here: Ostrava/CZ).

    $ python example_download.py 
      Data progress: 100.0%

    Downloaded to ./obs/S1_asc: 60
      Data progress: 100.0%

    Downloaded to ./obs/S1_dsc: 60
      Data progress: 100.0%

      CLM progress: 100.0%

      100%||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| 36/36 [00:01<00:00, 31.61it/s]
    Downloaded to ./obs/S2: 36

### Convert GeoTIFF Files
If preprocessed `GeoTIFF` files are already available, these can be easily converted to `EOPatch` samples, for the region specified in a shape file (here: Ostrava/CZ). In the example below, a single `Level 1 Landsat 5 TM` observation from Octrober 1993 is converted. Note that the `GeoTIFF` covers a larger area but the conversion only considers (subsets) the region from the shape file.

    $ python example_convert.py 
    EOPatch(
      data={
        Bands: numpy.ndarray(shape=(1, 46, 87, 7), dtype=float32)
      }
      mask={
        Mask: numpy.ndarray(shape=(1, 46, 87, 1), dtype=uint16)
      }
      bbox=BBox(((18.14081078, 49.83455151), (18.17269592, 49.85132019)), crs=CRS('4326'))
      timestamp=[datetime.datetime(1993, 10, 10, 9, 0, 51)]
    )


## Stage 2: Stack, Assemble, and Tile
    $ python example_stack.py 
    Resolutions (y, x):
        OPT: 178, 236
        SAR: 178, 236
    Total time stamps: 138
    Effective time stamps (from 'starttime' with 'delta_step' steps): 65
    List of observations to process:
    2017-01-01 05:00:30
    2017-01-01 10:04:07
    ...
    2017-06-30 05:00:20
    2017-06-30 10:00:25
    Total writes:  65


## Stage 3: Windowing
### For Training/Validation Data
The following creates windows with labels (just dummies with values of one) and stores them on the file system.

    $ python example_window_training.py 
    List of window ranges (current):
    2017-01-02 04:52:47 2017-02-01 04:52:17
    2017-01-04 16:34:04 2017-02-01 04:52:17
    ...
    2017-06-01 04:52:06 2017-06-30 10:00:25
    2017-06-03 16:34:37 2017-06-30 10:00:25
    Writing training files:
      Progress: 90.0%

    Writing validation files:
      Progress: 75.0%

### For Inference
For inference, either the windows can be stored on the file system (offline) or directly used with a model (online).
Note that labels are not created in any of the inference examples, but is possible, too.

# Use rsdtlib for ERCNN-DRS
In our previous work of [ERCNN-DRS Urban Change Monitoring](https://github.com/It4innovations/ERCNN-DRS_urban_change_monitoring) the time series processing of (an early version of) `rsdtlib` was used. See subdirectory [`./ERCNN-DRS`](./ERCNN-DRS) for the pre-processing scripts.

# Use rsdtlib for monitoring Mariupol, Ukraine
The `rsdtlib` library was also used in our work of [Monitoring Urban Changes in Mariupol/Ukraine](https://github.com/It4innovations/urban_change_monitoring_mariupol_ua). See subdirectory [`./urban_change_monitoring_mariupol_ua`](./urban_change_monitoring_mariupol_ua) for the pre-processing scripts.
